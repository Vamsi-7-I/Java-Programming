Types of Programming:-
1. Procedural -> specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures to compose a program.It contains
systematic order of statements,functions and commands to complete a task
2. Functional -> writing a program only in pure functions i.e., never modify variables but creates new ones
as an output.
3. Object oriented -> revolves around object. code + data = object. developed to make it easier to reuse,
develop,debug and main software

Static vs Dynamic Languages
1. static -> perform type checking done at compile time. error is shown at compile time. declare data types
before we use it. more control
2. dynamic -> performs type checking at run time. error is not shown till the program is run. no need to
declare variable data types. saves time in writing code but error might come in runtime

how java code executes?
                            (COMPILER)                          (INTERPRETER)
Java File(Human Readable) --------------> Class File(Byte Code) --------------> Machine Code(0's and 1's)
                           (ENTIRE FILE)                        (LINE BY LINE)
source code is converted to byte code. so, java is platform independent
byte code is converted to machine code by using jvm . jvm is platform dependent
